I recently completed a hands-on project where I automated the setup of an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI, installed Apache, and hosted a website all without using the AWS Management Console! ðŸŽ‰
Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

Launched an EC2 Instance: Utilized the AWS CLI to create a t2.micro instance, leveraging the free tier and configuring it programmatically.

Connected via SSH: Accessed the instance securely using SSH with my key pair for further configuration.

Automated Apache Installation: Implemented a user-data script to update packages, install Apache, and start the service automatically.

Hosted a Website: Created a simple HTML page and served it through Apache, verifying the setup by accessing it via the instanceâ€™s public IP.

This project enhanced my skills in cloud automation and infrastructure management. You can read more about this project in my latest Medium blog post https://lnkd.in/g8XgscVh
